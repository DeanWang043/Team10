## Milestone 1: Figuring Out Figure 8s
Lab 1 was most of the Team 10 members' first experience with robotics.
### The Goal

For Milestone 1, we have two primary objectives:
- Successfully implement line following - where black tape on a white background represents the line
- Successfully traverse the grid in a figure eight.

#### Materials

- 2x Continuous Servo Motors
- 2x [Analog Line Sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9453)
- Arduino Uno
- Robot Chassis
- 9V Battery
- Breadboard
- Appropriate Connectors and Headers


### Line Follower
Since our servo motors were calibrated fairly well in Lab, our robot moves in a straight line on the grid, with minimum need for correction.
We attach two sensor at the front of the robot (from Lab 1) as shown below<br>






### Figure Eight




### Future Possible Modifications / Notes
- We can possibly incorporate a four sensor arrangement for better control; however, our current iteration works well
- If there is a change in the chassis, the threshold values for the line sensors have to be tested again



### Conclusion
We successfully added line following functionality to our robot from Lab 1. Building further on the line follower robot, we added the functionality of making right angled turns. Using line following and the ability to make right angled turns, we further programmed the robot to move in a figure eight
