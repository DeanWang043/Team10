## Lab 1: Microcontroller
Lab 1 was most of the Team 10's first experience to robotics.
### The Goal
In this lab,the team explored the various funtionalities of the Arduino Uno,eventually building up enough ability to construct a simple autonomous robot.

### Blink
This being the first time that most team members have experimented with an Arduino, we began by uploading and running the device'smost primitive sketch - "Blink".
