```


### 10/16/17
```markdown
Goals:
- Discuss Lab 3

Notes:
- Lab 3
    - Due tomorrrow 

- Lab 4 due next week
    - Wireless communication
    
- Mechanical
    - keep the servo, have the servos on top
```


### 10/20/17
```markdown
Goals:
- Discuss Lab 4
- Discuss future deadlines
- Discuss future goals for overall project?

Notes:
- Lab 4 VGA team needs to work on packet receiving not neccessarily wirelessly
- Need to determine final maze scheme and graphics (right now just solid colored square grid)
- Packets will consist of 1 byte (3 bits for x coordinate, 2 bits for the y coordinate, 3 for state)
- Wireless communication needs line of sight
- Brainstorm maze pictures for next meeting
- Ask TAs about pictures on FPGA
- Come up with team logo for wheels and engrave names in chassis
- Ask about laser 
- Create merch
- Find out how ordering things work

Action Items:
- Ask TAs questions above!!
```

### 10/30/17
```markdown
Goals:
- Discuss updates on Lab 4 FPGA Team
- Discuss milestone 3

Notes:
- Lab 4 FPGA - Minor problems remaining
- TAs donâ€™t know the answer
- Team FPGA will go on 31st Oct, 2017 and solve their FPGA bugs
- DFS vs BFS
- Library for queues and stacks on Arduino or implement our own?
- Library exists for both
